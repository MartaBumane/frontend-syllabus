# Video Store

The goal of this optional exercise is to design and implement a simple inventory control system for a small video rental store. Define least two classes: a class Video to model a video and a class VideoStore to model the actual store.

Assume that a Video may have the following state:

 - a title;
 - a flag to say whether it is checked out or not;
 - an average user rating.

In addition, Video has the following behaviour:

 - being checked out;
 - being returned;
 - receiving a rating.
 
The VideoStore may have the state of videos in there currently. The VideoStore will have the following behaviour:

 - add a new video (by title) to the inventory;
 - check out a video (by title);
 - return a video to the store;
 - take a user's rating for a video;
 - list the whole inventory of videos in the store.
 
Finally, test the functionality of your two classes. It should allow the following.

 - Add 3 videos: "The Matrix", "Godfather II", "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope".
 - Give several ratings to each video.
 - Rent each video out once and return it.
 - List the inventory after "Godfather II" has been rented out out.
 
Summary of design specs:

 - Store a library of videos identified by title.
 - Allow a video to indicate whether it is currently rented out.
 - Allow users to rate a video and display the percentage of users that liked the video.
 - Print the store's inventory, listing for each video:
    - its title,
    - the average rating,
    - and whether it is checked out or on the shelves.
